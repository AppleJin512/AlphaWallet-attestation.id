  <h1>This website will be an Email Address attestor</h1>
  <p>This website will be an email address attestor, meaning that it
  issues cryptographically signed attestation to prove that an
    Ethereum key-holder owns the email address he claims.</p>

  <p>A visitor to acquire such an attestation will need to provide his
  email address (signed), let us verify the email address by a typing
    verification code sent to their email address.</p>

  <p>The flow (once complete) will look like
    this <a href="Email_Attestation_Preview.pdf">PDF preview</a>.</p>


  <h2>Who is doing this?</h2>
  <p>Currently this website is operated by TokenScript team to
  demonstrate the use of attestation on the blockchain and for the web
    services that accepts attestations.</p>

  <h2>Is this reinventing the wheel?</h2>
  
  <p>In the past decades, there have been web-of-trust services to
  provide cryptographically signed messages to attest to user's email
    address, but there are 2 reasons we can't use them on the blockchain.</p>
  <ul><li>They do not accept secp256k1 the Elliptic Curve used in
  blockchains;</li><li> and they issue attestations without
  cryptographically hiding the email address being attested, making
  such attestations unsafe on the blockchain.</li></ul>
  <p>This service
  uses <a href="https://github.com/AlphaWallet/blockchain-attestation/blob/master/use-cases/send-ether-by-identifier-attestation.md">the
  algorithm</a> which uses elliptic curve and zero-knowledge proof to
  provide privacy and security, so that the attestation can be used on
    the blockchain.</p>
  <p>We hope to see more attestors using the new blockchain-safe algorithm.</p>
